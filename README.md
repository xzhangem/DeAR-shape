# DeAR-shape
Implementation of "DeAR: Deformation-Aware Reguarlization Based Anatomical Shape Model".

### Dependencies
We highly recommend using Anaconda enviornment with available NVIDIA graphics card and CUDA drivers. The basic packages include PyTorch, PyKeops and PyTorch3d, other related tools are included in the pytorch3d.yaml file. You can import the environments via yaml file as follows:

`conda env create -f pytorch3d.yaml`
