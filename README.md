# DeAR-shape
Implementation of "DeAR: Deformation-Aware Reguarlization Based Anatomical Shape Model".

### Getting Started
We highly recommend using Anaconda enviornment. The basic packages include PyTorch, PyKeops and PyTorch3d, other related tools are included in the pytorch3d.yaml file. You can import the environments via yaml file as follows:

`conda env create -f pytorch3d.yaml`

### Descriptions

The graphical abstract of the proposed DeAR shape metric is summarzied in the figure below:
